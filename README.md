WRO Future Engineers – Galaxy Creators

Overview

This repository contains the engineering materials for our autonomous vehicle developed for the WRO Future Engineers Competition 2025. The vehicle is designed using 3D-printed structural components, LEGO gear and support systems, and is powered by an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller. It includes all necessary documentation, code, schematics, and media files to showcase the design, construction, and functionality of our self-driving robot.

⚙️ Technical Introduction

· The vehicle combines custom-designed 3D-printed parts with LEGO gear systems to form a functional and modular robotic platform. It features a drive system, a steering mechanism,    onboard sensors, and a power system all managed by an Arduino UNO.

🔧 Modules

· motor_control.ino: Controls a DC motor for propulsion and a servo motor for steering.

· ultrasonic.ino: Handles distance measurements from ultrasonic sensors.

· main.ino: Integrates all modules and controls behavior based on sensor input.

🔩 Electromechanical Design

· Chassis: Fully 3D-printed, designed to house all components securely, including the electronics and internal battery pack.

· Supports: LEGO elements are used as modular supports and for integrating gear mechanisms.

· Gearing: A system of LEGO gears transmits torque from the DC motor to the drive wheels.

· Steering: A servo motor turns the front axle using a 3D-printed linkage system.

· Sensors: Two ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles and measure distances.

· Power Supply: The robot is powered by a rechargeable battery pack mounted inside the chassis.

· Controller: All logic is run by an Arduino UNO, connected to motors and sensors through the chassis.

🧪 Build & Execution Instructions

· Open the .ino files in the Arduino IDE.

· Connect your Arduino UNO via USB to your computer.

· Under the Tools menu, select the correct board (Arduino UNO) and port.

· Press Upload to flash the code.

· Disconnect USB and power the vehicle via the internal battery to begin autonomous operation.

🎯 Project Objective

· Our objective is to design a reliable, fully autonomous vehicle using a hybrid structure made of 3D-printed elements and LEGO mechanics, controlled by Arduino-based logic. This     allows flexibility in design, rapid prototyping, and a clear demonstration of STEM learning.

🔍 Additional Notes

· The combination of LEGO gears and custom-printed parts enhances mechanical precision.

· The battery pack is safely integrated inside the chassis for optimal space usage.

· All modules are modular and replaceable, promoting ease of maintenance and iteration.
